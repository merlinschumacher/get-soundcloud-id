# Get Soundcloud Id

A simple website to get the ID of a Soundcloud track, playlist or artist.

Since about 2018 it's not possible anymore to get the ID of a Soundcloud page, like a playlist, user or song, via their API. This tool makes getting the ID easier.

You'll might need this tool if you want to integrate a Soundcloud plugin for a content management system like Wordpress or a static site generator (like Jekyll).
